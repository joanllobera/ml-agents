    "<b>a)</b> In the case of our example the <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">rewards</span> are 4 float variables being two of them the rewards and the other two the punishments. There are 4 variables because there are two types of brains that we want to train, the <b>Goalie</b> which has the role of defending the scoring area and the <b>Striker</b> who has the role of scoring, thus we have the variables called <kbd>strikerPunish</kbd> which gives the agent a negative reward (-1) and <kbd>strikerReward</kbd> which gives the agent a positive reward (+1) to the <b>Striker</b>. The same goes for the variables of the <b>Goalie</b> which are called <kbd>goaliePunish</kbd> and <kbd>goalieReward</kbd>, both of them work exactly as the <b>Striker</b> ones.\n",

    "<b>b)</b> On this example the <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">states</span> will be represented as a class named <kbd>PlayerState</kbd> which embodies the characteristics of the player, like the <kbd>playerIndex</kbd> which will be recived from the <kbd>AgentSoccer</kbd> cpp; the <kbd>agentRB</kbd> which is the rigid body of the agent, the <kbd>AgentSoccer</kbd> type called <kbd>agentScript</kbd> that will be used to know the characteristics of the agent like which team it is into or if it is a striker or a goalie, and the variable <kbd>ballPosReward</kbd>.\n",
