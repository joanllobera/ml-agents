    "<b>a)</b> In the case of our example the <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">rewards</span> are 4 float variables being two of them the rewards and the other two the punishments. There are 4 variables because there are two types of brains that we want to train, the <b>Goalie</b> which has the role of defending the scoring area and the <b>Striker</b> who has the role of scoring, thus we have the variables called <kbd>strikerPunish</kbd> which gives the agent a negative reward (-1) and <kbd>strikerReward</kbd> which gives the agent a positive reward (+1) to the <b>Striker</b>. The same goes for the variables of the <b>Goalie</b> which are called <kbd>goaliePunish</kbd> and <kbd>goalieReward</kbd>, the first one works like the <b>Striker</b> ones but the second one gives 0 so there is no reward for the goalie unless we modify it on the inspector.\n",

    "This variables can be changed on the Unity inspector, these are the default values:\n",

    "\n",
    "This variables are on the <kbd>SoccerAcademy</kbd> script.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>b)</b> On this example the <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">states</span> will be represented as a class named <kbd>PlayerState</kbd> which embodies the characteristics of the player, like the <kbd>playerIndex</kbd> which will be recived from the <kbd>AgentSoccer</kbd> script; the <kbd>agentRB</kbd> which is the rigid body of the agent, the <kbd>AgentSoccer</kbd> type called <kbd>agentScript</kbd> that will be used to know the characteristics of the agent like which team it is into or if it is a striker or a goalie, and the variable <kbd>ballPosReward</kbd>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/PlayerState.jpg'>\n",
    "\n",
    "This class will be used for the four agents that will be generated on the example and the class will be saved in a list called <kbd>PlayerStates</kbd> which will save all the <kbd>PlayerState</kbd> classes to be used to assign the rewards and punishments so the brain can be trained.\n",

    "\n",
    "This elements can be found on the script called <kbd>SoccerFieldArea</kbd>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>c)</b> The training is implemented using two diferent kind of brains the brain for the <b>Goalie</b> which we called <kbd>NewGoalieLearning</kbd> and the brain for the <b>Striker</b> which is called <kbd>NewStrikerLearning</kbd>, each of this brains will be attached to the script that corresponds to the class that they should be on. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/Brains.jpg'>\n",

    "After implementig this brains we will input the necessary parameters to the <b>Academy</b> game object in order to proceed with the training and we attach the brains to this game object script and set them on control mode.\n",

    "<img src='img/AcademyScript.jpg'>\n",

    "Note that we can change the number of observation our agent makes on the iteration by changing the space size on the vector observation on the brain in the inspector.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/BrainInspector.jpg'>\n",
    "\n",
    "After this is done we have to set the parameters on the <kbd>trainer_config.yaml</kbd> to the values we want so the training proceeds as planed, the folder where the <kbd>.yaml</kbd> is called config, it must be open via notepad, on this file we can change the number of steps that we want our example to train, the speed of the stepts it takes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='img/trainerConfigFile.jpg'>\n",

    "After that the command <kbd>mlagents-learn config/trainer_config.yaml --run-id=X --train</kbd> (if wanted to be trained on build this is the command <kbd>mlagents-learn config/trainer_config.yaml --env=../../projects/Cats/CatsOnBicycles.app --run-id=cob_1 --train</kbd>) must be entered on the <b>anaconda prompt</b> in orther for the training to start. With this done we have to revise the code.\n",

    "The script <kbd>AgentSoccer</kbd> keeps the information of the agent, having here the what refers to the agent's team, the actions that it will take and the roles that will adopt. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script <kbd>SoccerAcademy</kbd> will act as the manager of the training, initializing the important variables like the punishments, the rewards, the brains, the agent steps, etc. \n",

    "\n",
    "The script <kbd>SoccerFieldArea</kbd> is the most important of all, being the one that embodies the main functions that will make the training possible. The functions that will make that possible are the following: <kbd>GoalTouched</kbd> and <kbd>RewardOrPunishPlayer</kbd>. To use correctly this functions on the script we create a class, which is the same class that we mentioned on the <b>b)</b> section, which is called <kbd>PlayerState</kbd>, this will define the agent characteristics that will be added to the the list <kbd>playerStates</kbd> which will contain all the agents that will be trained. After having this clear we go to the function <kbd>GoalTouched</kbd>, that will iterate on the list that we mentioned and check which team has scored and give them a reward for it, or a punish in the case they got scored, it will also restart the coroutine after the scoring and also will randomize the players teams for training.\n",

    "<img src='img/GoalTouched.jpg'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have the <kbd>RewardOrPunishPlayer</kbd> function that will be used on the function we have just seen, it will recive three parameters: the player, the striker and the goalie rewards/punishes; it will activate when a team has scored (as we have seen on the previous paragraph) and it will give add a reward or a punish to the striker and goalie depending if they where scored or they scored. \n",
